# odin-recipes
This is the first project that I created while following the oding project.
The project for the HTML foundation is to create a recipe webpage.
Finishing this project ensures that I have learnt basic HTML elements and was able to apply some attributes as well.
To follow the learning material, I used inline styles instead of creating a css file.
To follow a single layout the inline styles are copied in each html file.
