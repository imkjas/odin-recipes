    <p>
      Carbonara is a classic <strong>Italian pasta dish</strong> made with eggs,
      Pecorino Romano cheese, pancetta (or guanciale), and black pepper. It's
      known for its <em>creamy texture</em>‚Äîachieved without using cream‚Äîcreated
      by tossing hot pasta with the egg and cheese mixture. Traditionally made
      with spaghetti, carbonara is rich, savory, and deeply satisfying.

    <h3 style="color: #432818;">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>400g (14oz) spaghetti</li>
      <li>150g (5 oz) pancetta or guanciale <em>(diced)</em></li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
      <li>100g (1 cup) Pecorino Romano cheese <em>(finely grated)</em></li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper <em>(to taste)</em></li>
      <li>Salt <em>(for pasta water)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="color: #432818;">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Boil the Pasta:</strong>
        <p>
          Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and
          cook until al dente according to the package instructions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Egg Mixture:</strong>
        <p>
          In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolk, grated Pecorino Romano
          cheese, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Set
          aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the Pancetta/Guanciale:</strong>
        <p>
          In a large skillet, cook the diced pancetta or guanciale over medium
          heat until it becomes crispy and the fat renders. This should take
          about 5‚Äì7 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combine Pasta and Meat:</strong>
        <p>
          Once the pasta is cooked, reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water and
          then drain the pasta. Add the hot pasta to the skillet with the crispy
          pancetta (with the heat turned off or on very low to avoid scrambling
          the eggs).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mix in the Egg Mixture:</strong>
        <p>
          Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing quickly and
          continuously. The residual heat will gently cook the eggs, creating a
          creamy sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, add some of the reserved
          pasta water gradually until you reach your desired consistency.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Finish and Serve:</strong>
        <p>
          Taste and adjust the seasoning with extra black pepper if needed.
          Serve immediately while it‚Äôs warm and creamy.
        </p>
      </li>
